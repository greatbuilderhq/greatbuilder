#### Prerequisite

    ```bash
    npm i -g npm
    ```

#### Step by step

1. Fork the official [GreatBuilder Github Repository](https://github.com/greatbuilderhq/greatbuilder).

2. Clone your forked repository.

3. Create a new branch, see [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository). Naming conventions:

   - For feature branch: `feature/<Your New Feature>`
   - For bug fix branch: `bugfix/<Your New Bugfix>`.

4. Switch to the newly created branch.

5. Go into repository folder

   ```bash
   cd GreatBuilder
   ```

6. Install all dependencies of all modules:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

7. Build all the code:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

8. Start the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

9. For development:

   - Create `.env` file and specify the `PORT` (refer to `.env.example`) in `packages/ui`
   - Create `.env` file and specify the `PORT` (refer to `.env.example`) in `packages/server`
   - Run

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   For changes made in `packages`, run `npm run build` again to pickup the changes.

10. After making all the changes, run

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    and

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

    to make sure everything works fine in production.

11. Commit code and submit Pull Request from forked branch pointing to [GreatBuilder master](https://github.com/greatbuilderhq/greatbuilder/tree/master).
